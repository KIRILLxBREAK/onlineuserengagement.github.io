<p>In the online world, user engagement refers to the quality of the user experience that emphasizes the positive aspect of the interaction with an online service and, in particular, the phenomena associated with wanting to use that service longer and more frequently. User engagement is a key concept in the design of online services, as successful applications are not just used, but are engaged with. Users invest time, attention, and emotion with services they use. How to measure user engagement and being able to drive it becomes a key element for evaluating the success of any online services, from news to e-commerce sites, as it informs on the understanding of user needs and expectations, system design and functionality.</p>

<p>User engagement is a multifaceted, complex phenomenon, and as such has given rise to a number of approaches for its measurement. Common ways of measuring user engagement include: self-reporting, e.g., questionnaires; observational methods, e.g., desktop actions; and online analytics, which employ online behavior metrics that assess usersâ€™ depth of engagement. These approaches represent various trade-offs between the scale of data analyzed and the depth of understanding. In this tutorial, we focus on the later, large-scale online analytics. Within this approach, the most common way that engagement is measured is through various proxy measures of user engagement. Standard metrics include number of page views, number of unique users, dwell time, bounce rate, click-through rate, and return rate. We will review these metrics, and discuss what they measure, their advantages and drawbacks. We will provide extensive details on the appropriateness of these metrics to various types of online services.</p>

<p>Once metrics are identified and measured, it becomes a challenge to derive a mechanism to optimize them. From a machine learning perspective, two types of approaches are exploited to drive metrics, directly optimizing a metric when it can be formalized easily in a mathematical form, or indirectly through some surrogate objective functions. From an experimental design perspective, certain metrics can be easily observed and improved during a period of time of an online A/B experiment in terms of several weeks while the change of other metrics, especially long term ones, can be difficult or even never observed and improved directly through experiments. In this tutorial, we will discuss these aspects and explore new research directions.</p>

<p>Throughout the tutorial, we will use applications in areas we have extensive experiences, news, search, entertainment, and e-commerce to demonstrate how online user engagement can be measured and optimized.</p>
